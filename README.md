# Modern Classroom

A modern, self-paced learning dashboard for students and teachers. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

Students work through unit sections at their own pace — completing Learn, Practice, and Extra Material in order, uploading proof of work, and updating their status as they go. Teachers get a live progress grid, a draggable progress gate to control how far the class can move, and review workflows for submitted screenshots.

**Demo mode** — no backend or login required. Progress and the teacher progress gate are stored in the browser via `localStorage`.

## Features

### Student view
- Unit banner and section navigation (sidebar on desktop, bottom sheet on mobile)
- Sequential unlock: Learn → Practice → Extra Material
- Status badge on each activity card (top-right dropdown): **In Progress**, **Done**, **Help Requested**, or **Locked**
- Practice requires a screenshot upload before marking Done
- Help requests do not block moving to the next activity or section
- Teacher progress gate limits access to sections beyond the gated point
- Light and dark mode

### Teacher view
- Class progress table with status per student and section
- Status types: **Done**, **Review** (yellow), **Active**, **Help** (red), not started
- **Progress gate** — draggable red line on the progress table; students cannot access sections past the gate
- Click **Review** to view a student's submitted screenshot and approve it
- Stat cards with detail modals (enrolled students, help requests, progress breakdown)
- Section breakdown charts

## Project structure

```
app/                  # Next.js routes (home, student, teacher)
components/           # UI components
  student/            # Student dashboard, activity cards, sidebar
  teacher/            # Teacher dashboard, progress gate overlay
lib/                  # Types, demo data, progress logic, localStorage stores
public/               # Static assets (Logo.png, favicons)
scripts/              # Utility scripts
```

## Demo data

The app ships with eight demo students and progress for **Unit 3: Linear Models and Systems** (sections 3.1–3.7). No student has completed work past **3.4** in the seed data. The default progress gate is also set to **3.4** — drag the red line on the teacher table to open more sections.

Switch between students on the student view to see different progress states.

### Resetting demo state

Progress is persisted in `localStorage` under `modern-classroom-progress`. The progress gate uses `modern-classroom-progress-block`. Clear those keys in devtools (or use a fresh/incognito window) to reload the seed data.
